EVENTS:
	api.registerEve('event', function)
	Should pull events from const (deaths) and allow for dynamic ones, so modules can do, api.registerHook('hook', **args) and then api.fireHook('hook')

- Kick/Banning
- Slapping/Nuking
- Team Killing
- Match Managment
- Database
- Threading


TODOS:
- Add a DB handler [In progress]
	- database.py is incomplete: aliases, penalties
	- DB methods shouldn't be returning data straight from db (clientSearch())
	- SQLite plugin could be rewritten to be more pythonish (very klumsy)
- Add basic commands, work on API [Waiting...]
- Add lots of events [Semi-in progress]
- Add ability to reboot bot
- Authentication
	- CONFIG:
	- Bot Method (Four methods,)
		- Method 1: User must match GUID/IP/NICK to be auto-logged in
		- Method 2: User must match GUID/IP, GUID/NICK to be auto-logged in...
		- Method 3: User must match GUID/IP, GUID/NICK or IP/NICK to be auto-logged in
		- Method 4: User must match NICK to be logged in...
	- Min Required Level (Anyone on or above must use !login to authenticate)
