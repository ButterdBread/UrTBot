EVENTS:
	api.registerEve('event', function)
	Should pull events from const (deaths) and allow for dynamic ones, so modules can do, api.registerHook('hook', **args) and then api.fireHook('hook')

- Kick/Banning -- kick is trivial, banning (!ban etc): see note about penalty plugin
- Team Killing -- part of fairplay?
- Match Managment
- Threading
	- so far so good, gj man


TODOS:
- Add a DB handler [In progress]
	- SQLite plugin could be rewritten to be more pythonish (very klumsy)
	- Good example plugin should be written [Stats?]
- Add basic commands, work on API [In progress]
DONE - Add lots of events [Semi-in progress] -- I'd say this is done? We can always add more
- Add ability to reboot bot
	- I'm ignorant, what's the status on this? [No fucking clue what ima do...]
- Authentication
	- CONFIG:
	- Bot Method (Four methods,)
DONE		- Method 1: User must match GUID/IP/NICK to be auto-logged in
DONE		- Method 2: User must match GUID/IP, GUID/NICK to be auto-logged in...
		- Method 3: User must match GUID/IP, GUID/NICK or IP/NICK to be auto-logged in -- LAZZZYY me, I'll check this off soon.
DONE		- Method 4: User must match NICK to be logged in...
				- Maybe this should be GUID instead of NICK? NICK offers... nothing for security. Nada! Good for testing tho.
	- Min Required Level (Anyone on or above must use !login to authenticate)
- Figure out what is causing the double-rcon commands. (random doubling) [Havent observed this, make this an issue yea?]
DONE - Add name completion method to API (for !kick, etc.)
- Add a stats plugin [In progress]
	- held up by the db but it should be good to go now
- Add a penalty plugin
	- ban, mute management, etc. I'd like this in a plugin and not in core. Thoughts? [Prolly in default yes? or seperate?]
- Fairplay plugin:
	- !teams could be smarter
	DONE - !force team w/ 'lock'/'unlock' should be added

STUPID URT THINGS:
- Figure out all the weapon hits/etc
- hotpotato (flags go boom) does not print a flag return msg.
	the flag gets dropped and goes BOOM without any further notification.
	this screws up the flagstats code. solutions are all hacky. :|
- track down all the things that can happen without notifying us on stdout (this'll just happen over time)

THINGS THAT ARE GOING VERY WELL:
The plugin system is seckzy; Looking forward to having fun with it when the core is more settled.
